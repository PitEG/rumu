x Launch
x Check if every file in database still exists (exists in the file system)
  x Delete any entries that don't exist (this prevents them from seeing songs that don't exist in the fs)
- Allow user to use the app now
- Concurrently, look through the specified music folders
  - Check for new songs (files that succeed being ffprobed)
    - add any new ones in
  - Update songs if their files were changed (this may be kind of expensive)
    - a quick way to check if file changed is by just looking at the size of the file, sometimes might not notice a change
    - probably should only be done when asked and should be limited to be done per album
