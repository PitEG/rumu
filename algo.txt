- Launch
- Check if every file in database still exists (exists in the file system)
  - Delete any entries that don't exist
- Allow user to use the app now (this prevents them from seeing songs that don't exist in the fs)
- Concurrently, look through the specified music folders
  - Check for new songs (files that succeed being ffprobed)
    - add any new ones in
  - Update files if they were changed (this is kind of expensive)
    - probably should only be done when asked and should be limited to be done per album
