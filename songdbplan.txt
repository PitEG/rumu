# Idea 1
There should be a single database that has all the songs. So, there isn't really a need
to maintain foreign key restraints, but I should still declare a key I think

To make the minimal key, I think all I need is the song title, album, and artist
Since there could be multiple artists, I want to be able to include them still

Song(Title -> Key, Album -> Key, Artist -> Key, TrackNumber, Genre, Year)

# Idea 2

I could have multiple tables when I expect songs to have multiple instances of a tag.
For example, a song could have multiple artists or multiple genres.
So instead I could make use of foreign keys and do something like this:

Hash used for versioning. If a was updated since last checked, the hash should be different.

Song(Title (K), Album (K), TrackNumber, Year, Hash)

Artist(Title (FK), Album (FK), Artist)

Genre(Title (FK), Album(FK), Genre)

Lyrics(Title (FK), Album(FK), Lyrics)
